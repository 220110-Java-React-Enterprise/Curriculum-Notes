/*
Bubble sort works by moving a "bubble" through the array, the bubble is two elements next to each other.
For instance the first possible bubble is elements at index 0 and index 1.
Each time this bubble moves through the array, re-order the two elements into the sorted order
Then move the bubble until we reach the last two elements.
Repeat this process until we complete one full iteration without making any swaps.
