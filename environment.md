# Development Environment - Apps & Tools
#### A Note About Operating Systems:
I work primarily in Windows and am not very familiar with Mac OS or GUI Linux distributions. I would very much suggest you have a windows machine available to use during this course, if possible. However, you can use whatever OS you like. You might also consider some virtual solution to emulate Windows. This is a high-skill curriculum and assisting with basic OS functionality is outside the scope of this course. I will not be rendering assistance with downloading, installing, copying files, etc. When we work with non-trivial tasks I will offer whatever assistance I can. Keep in mind, you should be familiar with your own environment (specifically your OS). 


## Environment
We will use the following software during training, which will need to be installed locally on your machine. We will cover installation and setup of each together.

- [OpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot) - Java Development Kit (We want version 8 with HotSpot)
- [Apache Tomcat 8](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi) - Webserver (We want version 8 core)

## Apps & Tools:
Below are the applications we will be using in this course. These are all available for free:

 - [IntelliJ Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) - Java IDE
 - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - Text editor with extensions
