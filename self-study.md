# Self Study
From time to time I may assign self study topics. These are items which we may not have time to cover fully in lecture and which I believe you should be able to google up and learn without me dryly reading to you. Please do not hesitate to ask me about these topics either during or outside class. I will refrain from assigning nuanced and difficult subject matter as self study, but please do not think these items are of less importance. Everything in our curriculum is important, and it is still likely QC will ask you about these topics.
