#  History of Angular

Angular is a **TypeScript-based open-source framework** used to develop **dynamic web applications**.

Angular is a [Single Page Application](./spa.md) (SPA) Framework. An SPA is a web application that fits on a single page. All our code (JavaScript , HTML , CSS ) is retrieved with a single page load. Navigation between pages is performed without refreshing the whole page.


### Angular Versions with release dates

* AngularJS or Angular 1 - October 20, 2010
* Angular 2 - September 14, 2016
* Angular 4 - March 23, 2017
* Angular 5 - November 1, 2017
* Angular 6 - May 4th, 2018
* Angular 7 - October 18, 2018
* Angular 8 - May 28, 2019
* Angular 9 - February 6, 2020

**Angular** is commonly referred to as Angular 2+ or by one of the above versions, to distance the modern framework from the original AngularJS.

[AngularJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS) is a **JavaScript-based open-source front-end web framework**. It doesn't support the features of a server-side programming language, nor dynamic loading of the page. 

[Angular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_(web_framework)) is a **complete rewrite** of AngularJS. AngularJS was completely based on **controllers** and **scopes** whereas, Angular uses **component hierarchy** as its main architecture. 

### Angular JS vs Angular (Angularr 2+)

| Angular JS| Angular 4+|
| ------ | ------ |
| Uses MVC architecture to build the applications. |  Uses component based UI to build the applications.|
| AngularJS is written in JavaScript. | Angular is compatible with the most recent versions of TypeScript that have powerful type checking and object-oriented features. |
| To bind an image/property or an event with AngularJS, you have to remember the right ng directive. | Angular focuses on “( )” for event binding and “[ ]” for property binding.|
|AngularJS doesn't support mobiles. | Angular support mobiles. |

Angular uses the **TypeScript** language, which has features like :

* Static Typing
* Object-Oriented Programming based on classes
* Support for reactive programming using RxJS

The main building blocks of Angular are **modules**, **components**, **templates**, **metadata**, **data binding**, **directives**, **services**, and **dependency injection**. The following diagram shows how these building blocks of an Angular Application are related :

We'll discuss each block later in this section. 


## AngularJS vs Angular 4+

#### Introduction
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), also known as Angular 1, was created in 2009 by Google. It is a JavaScript open-source front-end framework. It still has a team working on its long term support till the end of 2021.

[Angular 4+](https://angular.io/), which has come all the way to version 12 now, is a TypeScript based open-source front-end framework made by the same team that made AngularJS.

#### Differences:
AngularJS uses JavaScript while Angular uses TypeScript. TypeScript is more modern with static typing, classes, and interfaces.

AngularJS uses **scopes** and **controllers** for their control logic. Angular uses **components** as its main architectural design. This helps structure and readability. Angular also has more emphasis on modularity.

#### Final Thoughts
Angular is more modern and actually has updates while AngularJS is about to finish its support lifecycle. Angular has many improvements over AngularJS, especially since it was designed to be an upgrade. However there is still a community of people who prefer AngularJS.
