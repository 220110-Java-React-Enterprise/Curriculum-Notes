# TypeScript

* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a **typed superset of JavaScript**. 
* It is an **open-source** and  **object-oriented programming language** that supports classes, interfaces, inheritance, modules, etc., developed by **Microsoft**. 
* It can be used to **manipulate the DOM** for adding or removing elements, similar to JavaScript. 
* It is **portable** across browsers, devices, and operating systems.
* It supports **strong typing** or **static typing**, unlike JavaScript. 
* TypeScript files are saved with a `.ts` extension and then "transpiled" into JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler. 
* TypeScript gets transpiled to JavaScript, which can run on any JavaScript runtime environment.(Eg: Node.js)

### Setting up Typescript

You can install Typescript using NPM (Node Package Manager) or the TypeScript Visual Studio Plugin.

After installing NPM, run the `npm install -g typescript` command to install TypeScript. To check the version, run the `tsc -v` command in the terminal. 

To compile the TypeScript code, run the `tsc` command, followed by the name of the file you are compiling. For example, `tsc hello.ts`. After compliation, typescript compiler creates a javascript file with the same name (hello.js). Run the javascript file using `node hello.js` command in the terminal.
