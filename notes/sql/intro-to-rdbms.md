# Intro to DBMS
DBMS stands for DataBase Management System. A database is a collection of data, and the management system is a set of programs to store and access that data in a quick and effective manner. Database systems are developed to handle large amounts of data. There are many features to modern database management systems and we will only be touching on a little of the subject matter. When we talk about persisting data in a database, what we technically mean is allowing a DBMS to persist that data in an instance of a database.
