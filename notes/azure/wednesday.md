### Creating an Azure Database for PostgreSQL. 
Use [this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/tutorial-design-database-using-azure-portal) and lecture videos to guide you. 

To get credit for this exercise, share your screen and show me connecting to the Postgre server via the Azure cloud shell. Make sure to have a database with a table already made so you can show off some insertions/selections. Again, feel free to be creative with this one!

Make sure to visit me in my breakout room if you have questions or want to show off your exercises. Once everyone is done, we can decide next steps together. Also, use this time to review articles on the Gitlab and finish up previous exercises.
