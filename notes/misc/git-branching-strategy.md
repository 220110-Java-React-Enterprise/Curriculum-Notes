# Git Worflow

 - Never change main directly, main is the central authority of good code. That means that we only merge good tested and complete code and features into main. Then we can expect that pulling from main gives us good tested and complete code.
 - Create your own feature/working branches to work with. Branch these off main with `git branch new-branch-name` or `git checkout -b new-branch-name`
