# Training Info
During this training I will be asking a lot of you. I will be spending several hours a day lecturing, and there will be numerous assessments, QC's, labs, assignments, and projects. Then when we get to P3 there will be the project as well as panels, portfolios, and even interviews. The next 10 weeks will be very busy and likely be very stressful. Just know that I went through this exact same curriculum as an associate. I understand the position you will be in, and I will do my best not to ask too much of you. The next 10 weeks will likely be very busy, you will be more likely to excel if you devote more time to study, preparation, and practice. However, you should fully expect to return to a normal work/life balance once the training concludes. You should not expect a culture of workaholism when working with any of our clients. The workload during training will start out heavy, and probably peak around P2 (though everyone's circumstances are unique). That said, by week 8 when you begin P3, things should start getting back to normal. 

# Business, Breaks, and Lunches
Our business week is Monday - Friday 9:00 AM CST - 5:00 PM CST. We will take an hour for lunch, and two breaks of >= 15 minutes. I will try to stick to a rough schedule every day, with a morning break, lunch at noon central, and an afternoon break. Sometimes we will deviate from this norm, however you should always get 60 minutes for lunch and two 15 minute breaks every day. The afternoon may be unstructured time, in which case feel free to take your break whenever approporiate. Our business day ends at 5:00 PM CST, you do not need to wait for me to dismiss you.

### Important: It's important I set this boundary now: I may not be able to stay late to answer questions or assist with material after business hours. I will generally not take questions during our lunches and breaks as it's unfair to the associates who aren't present. I will do everything I can to support you throughout this program, but I can't be on the hook 24/7.

# Plagarism
I should probably devise a better word to use. The definition of plagarism we will be operating under is probably a bit different that what you might expect. I do not mind if you find code online, share it with your peers, or even copy/paste code and refactor it into your own files. The only thing that matters, is if you submit any code as part of a project, or assignment that you understand it fully and completely. If you copy and paste code from somewhere and you do not understand it, **you are plagiarizing**. The most important thing is developing an understanding of the material in this course.
  
When it comes to QC code challenges, **do not collaborate or copy/paste at all**. Think of QC like an exam. All work must be your own.

# Unstructured/Project Time
Most days I will stop lecturing in the afternoon and give you unstructured time to work on labs, study, assignments, projects, etc. I have other responsibilities as well as meetings to attend, so whenever I am not available during our business day, you will be expected to use this unstructured time wisely and productively.

# Self Study Topics
Sometimes we just won't get the time to cover all the lecture material. From time to time I may assign some topics as self study. This doesn't mean these topics are less important or can be ignored. Everything on our curriculum is important and may very likely come up in QC or panels. I will provide you with any notes or content I have.

# QC
QCs are a series of informal assessments conducted by trainers and the QC department. Every week, starting in week 2, we will have a QC of one form or another. These are most likely to be verbal assessments about topics from the previous week, though you may be asked about any and all topics covered up to that point. There are also code challenges. Take these QCs very seriously, but don't stress yourself overmuch. They are important, but they are not the only way your progress will be measured. There will be a QC orientation where you will learn more.
  
#### When it comes to QC code challenges, **do not collaborate or copy/paste at all**. Think of QC like an exam. All work must be your own.

# Labs
From time to time I will assign labs for your practice. Labs are **not required**, but are probably the best way to learn the topics in our curriculum. I encourage you explore the labs as much as possible. They will be designed to elucidate concepts and prepare you for projects and assignments. I encourage you to collaborate on labs with your fellow associates. If you like to code (which I hope everyone here does) I would hope you find these educational and fun.

# Assignments
Assignments, unlike labs, **are required**. I expect these to be turned in (pushed) to the correct repository in our github orginization on time by everyone. I expect everyone's work **to be their own**. These will be graded, but the grades are for you and I to benchmark your skill and progress. 

# Projects
There will be a total of 4 projects you will all work on. We will start with Project 0, or P0, in week 1. P1, P2, and P3 will all be group projects. I will provide a document with very explicit requirements for P0-P2, and the CoE team will provide detailed requirements for the capstone project, P3.
  
Each project will be acompanied by a showcase, where everyone shows off their work. P3 will be a big presentation involving everyone, and there may be hundreds of attendees from Revature and beyond to see your work.

# Panels
Some time after week 8 you will be required to take "panels". Named for the style of the exam, a panel of experts would ask you technical and interview questions to test your knowlege and readiness for real interviews. Recently the panels have taken a new form, an online assessment. This represents the final exam, you'll learn more as the time approaches. 

# 1-on-1's
During unstructured time I will frequently be conducting 1-on-1 meetings with you and your peers. If you don't hear from me about setting up such a meeting, do not worry. These meetings are often used to discuss your individual progress, and if I don't reach out to you it just means I don't feel the need to discuss it (as in: you're doing great and I just don't have the time to tell you that). If for any reason you would like to discuss anything at all with me in a private setting, please feel free to reach out and we will schedule a 1-on-1. These can be time consuming, but I will make every effort to conduct any and all private meetings in a timely manner. It may mean we have to have our 1-on-1 during lunch or a break, but rest assured I'll give you the opportunity to make up that lost break time.

# Dress code
### Note: Dress code applies even if we are remote, and even if you don't expect to turn your camera on. You are required to abide by the dress code every day.
Our normal dress code is business casual. For the guys I can say this means a button up shirt or polo without graphics or text, tucked into long non-denim pants. For ladies, I have no clue, but if you need assistance with figuring out business casual I can put you in contact with a trainer more familiar with ladies' wardrobe options.
  
Sometimes we will dress up in business professional. This is the attire you should be wearing to interviews. Business professional will be required for showcases, panels, and interviews. We also expect you to wear business professional attire on your first days of client project until you have had the chance to see the expected dress code of the office. For the first few weeks of training I will ask you to wear business professional on Mondays. For men, business professional is casual + tie and jacket. Ladies, again I am not familiar enough with your options.
  
Sometimes we might have a "dress down" or casual day. For guys this means you can untuck those shirts and even wear jeans. Ladies, you get the drill by now. If you have any questions I can get in touch with someone to answer them. Profane or explicit text, graphics, or designs are never approporiate. Extremely suggestive or revealing clothing is also never approporiate.

# Zoom Ettiquite
We will be conducting our training in Zoom. Everyone needs a webcam and microphone of sufficent quality, this is an absolute requirement. 
 - You should be ready to turn on your camera at any time if I ask. 
 - I expect everyone to have their cameras on for at least a little bit daily, but I won't ask you to be on camera all day.
 - I don't always see all of the zoom chat, if you need something click "raise hand".
 - Everyone's mic should be muted at all times while they are not speaking. I will be muting you if you are making noise. If it becomes a problem we will have to have words.
 - Use the "raise hand" button to get my attention. Please avoid inturrupting by unmuting and speaking. I will pause and call on raised hands as soon as possible.
 - Please do not hesitate to raise your hand and ask me about anything at all. Don't be intimidated by these bulletpoints, I want to hear from you!
 - You will be required to have your camera on during presentations, QCs, panels, and interviews.
 
# Bullying
Don't do it. I expect everyone to be totally professional at all times. I have a zero tollerance policy for bullying and other unprofessional behavior. Please do not make me take action about unprofessionalism. You may not be best friends with everyone you work with, but you should be polite, courteous, and professional with everyone. If you are curious what constitutes unprofessional behavior or bullying, ask. Keep in mind, the other associates are your co-workers, and I am your supervisor. You represent Revature. Act accordingly.
