# Training Info
During this training I will be asking a lot of you. I will be spending several hours a day lecturing, and there will be numerous assessments, QC's, labs, assignments, and projects. Then when we get to P3 there will be the project as well as panels, portfolios, and even interviews. The next 10 weeks will be very busy and likely be very stressful. Just know that I went through this exact same curriculum as an associate. I understand the position you will be in, and I will do my best not to ask too much of you. The next 10 weeks will likely be very busy, you will be more likely to excel if you devote more time to study, preparation, and practice. However, you should fully expect to return to a normal work/life balance once the training concludes. You should not expect a culture of workaholism when working with any of our clients. The workload during training will start out heavy, and probably peak around P2 (though everyone's circumstances are unique). That said, by week 8 when you begin P3, things should start getting back to normal.
