# Training Info
During this training I will be asking a lot of you. I will be spending several hours a day lecturing, and there will be numerous assessments, QC's, labs, assignments, and projects. Then when we get to P3 there will be the project as well as panels, portfolios, and even interviews. The next 10 weeks will be very busy and likely be very stressful. Just know that I went through this exact same curriculum as an associate. I understand the position you will be in, and I will do my best not to ask too much of you. The next 10 weeks will likely be very busy, you will be more likely to excel if you devote more time to study, preparation, and practice. However, you should fully expect to return to a normal work/life balance once the training concludes. You should not expect a culture of workaholism when working with any of our clients. The workload during training will start out heavy, and probably peak around P2 (though everyone's circumstances are unique). That said, by week 8 when you begin P3, things should start getting back to normal. 

# Business, Breaks, and Lunches
Our business week is Monday - Friday 9:00 AM CST - 5:00 PM CST. We will take an hour for lunch, and two breaks of >= 15 minutes. I will try to stick to a rough schedule every day, with a morning break, lunch at noon central, and an afternoon break. Sometimes we will deviate from this norm, however you should always get 60 minutes for lunch and two 15 minute breaks every day. The afternoon may be unstructured time, in which case feel free to take your break whenever approporiate. Our business day ends at 5:00 PM CST, you do not need to wait for me to dismiss you.

## Important: It's important I set this boundary now: I may not be able to stay late to answer questions or assist with material after business hours. I will generally not take questions during our lunches and breaks as it's unfair to the associates who aren't present. I will do everything I can to support you throughout this program, but I can't be on the hook 24/7.

# Plagarism
I should probably devise a better word to use. The definition of plagarism we will be operating under is probably a bit different that what you might expect. I do not mind if you find code online, share it with your peers, or even copy/paste code and refactor it into your own files. The only thing that matters, is if you submit any code as part of a project, or assignment that you understand it fully and completely. If you copy and paste code from somewhere and you do not understand it, **you are plagiarizing**. The most important thing is developing an understanding of the material in this course.
  
When it comes to QC code challenges, **do not collaborate or copy/paste at all**. Think of QC like an exam. All work must be your own.

# Unstructured/Project Time
Most days I will stop lecturing in the afternoon and give you unstructured time to work on labs, study, assignments, projects, etc. I have other responsibilities as well as meetings to attend, so whenever I am not available during our business day, you will be expected to use this unstructured time wisely and productively.

# QC
QCs are a series of informal assessments conducted by trainers and the QC department. Every week, starting in week 2, we will have a QC of one form or another. These are most likely to be verbal assessments about topics from the previous week, though you may be asked about any and all topics covered up to that point. There are also code challenges. Take these QCs very seriously, but don't stress yourself overmuch. They are important, but they are not the only way your progress will be measured. There will be a QC orientation where you will learn more.

# Labs
From time to time I will assign labs for your practice. Labs are **not required**, but are probably the best way to learn the topics in our curriculum. I encourage you explore the labs as much as possible. They will be designed to elucidate concepts and prepare you for projects and assignments. I encourage you to collaborate on labs with your fellow associates. If you like to code (which I hope everyone here does) I would hope you find these educational and fun.

# Assignments
Assignments, unlike labs, **are required**. I expect these to be turned in (pushed) to the correct repository in our github orginization on time by everyone. I expect everyone's work **to be their own**. These will be graded, but the grades are for you and I to benchmark your skill and progress. 

# Projects
There will be a total of 4 projects you will all work on. We will start with Project 0, or P0, in week 1. P1, P2, and P3 will all be group projects. I will provide a document with very explicit requirements for P0-P2, and the CoE team will provide detailed requirements for the capstone project, P3.
  
Each project will be acompanied by a showcase, where everyone shows off their work. P3 will be a big presentation involving everyone, and there may be hundreds of attendees from Revature and beyond to see your work.
