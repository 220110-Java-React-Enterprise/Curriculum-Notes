# DevOps & Agile
Agile is a philosophy utilized when approaching the creation of information systems, and is a flexible approach of addressing the steps of the Software Development Life Cycle. Development teams who practice an Agile methodology place a focus on producing code through iteration and collabortion rather than following a rigid plan.
Though DevOps, which involves the creation of a systematic approach to producing code, and Agile, which is a mentality that focuses on creating products by adapting to change quickly, seem contradictory, the goal of both methodologies is to produce working and valuable product more efficiently. DevOps pertains to the entire system working together to produce, test, deploy and maintain the code base, while Agile practices allow for each step of that process to change wherever and whenever needed.  
  
Agile Practices with DevOps:

 - Continuous Integration
 - Continuous Delivery
 - Continuous Deployment


Adoption of the Agile philosophies can provide a stepping stone for the establishment of a working DevOps pipeline, as Agile practices intrinsically produce more continuous feedback loops. Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment seek to automate the phases of DevOps as much as possible.

Basically, Agile is about responding to changing needs during development by following an iterative loop of development and feedback. DevOps is about automating the processes of integrating, delivering, and deploying software to get quicker and better feedback. Putting these two together streamlines the entire SDLC.
