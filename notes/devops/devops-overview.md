# DevOps
DevOps, a combination of Development and Operations, is a set of practices and methodologies designed to combine the development (production/writing of code), deployment and maintenance of code into a streamlined process.  
  
The primary goal of DevOps is to expedite the lifecycle of application development, particularly through the automation of tasks.

The steps or phases for Dev Ops refers to the creation, testing, and deployment of an application.  
  
These steps include:  
  
 1. Source code Control: Producing (writing) code and pushing to a repository
 1. Building and Testing Automation: Test basic functionality of code (Generally unit testing) and create a new, working build
 1. Deploying to Staging: Deployment of working build to a temporary environment
 1. Acceptance Testing: Undergo other more complex tests (systems, integration) within temporary environment
 1. Deployment of Build: Migrate working build to Production environment accessible by end users
