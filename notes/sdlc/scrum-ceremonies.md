# Scrum Ceremonies
Scrum ceremonies are meetings used during the life cycle of the sprint in a project. All of the involved groups use them to give progress updates, promote general understanding between teams, create and track user stories, as well as gather data for sprint metrics. Scrum ceremonies are as time-sensitive as the sprints and are meant to only take as much time as is necessary.
 
### Types of Scrum Ceremonies
  - Sprint Planning
  - Daily Scrum/ Daily Stand-Up
  - Sprint Review
  - Sprint Retrospective
 
## Sprint Planning
 
Sprint planning is vital for the success of any sprint. This ceremony includes the development team, scrum master, and product owner and happens before the start of every sprint. The scope of the sprint, sprint goals, metrics and other specifics of the sprint(such as user stories and team composition) are decided and agreed upon.
- This ceremony is the longest: it is typically an hour per week of sprint
 
## Daily Scrum
 
Daily Scrum meetings are known as daily standups and are used to communicate progress, blockers, as well as communicate todayâ€™s agenda. It involves individuals "standing up" in front of the team to explain what they had done since the last standup and what they were planning on doing today. 
 
- This scrum ceremony is usually brief (under 15 minutes)
 
## Sprint Review
A sprint review involves all the parties interested in its progress. Invite as many people as you can to attend and give feedback. This is time for the scrum team to verbalize their hard work, progress, successes, and failures over the course of the sprint. The feedback on a sprint is vital for future sprints to be improved.
 
- typically runs between 45 minutes to an hour, excluding demo time
 
## Sprint Retro
Sprint reviews are about the product. In contrast, Sprint retrospective is about the process. This is time for the scrum master to bring forward the sprints metrics and for the scrum team as a whole to assess inefficiencies they came across in the last sprint. Then as a team, they make plans for improvement which are taken to the next sprint planning meeting.
 
-typically 45 minutes long
