## [Story Points](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/estimation)

Agile development has the product backlog which is a list of work that contains short descriptions of all the desired features for a product. The engineering team has to come up with estimated time of completion for the required features, this is called the estimation process. During this time it is vital to have good discussions on each requirement as this will help the whole team with understanding what exactly needs to be done and how it will be accomplished. Story points are important at this time.

##### Story Points

Story points are measurement units for expressing how much effort will have to go into fully implementing/the completion of a requirement or product backlog item. The team as a whole assigns story points based on complexity, amount of work and risk of change/uncertainty. Values are assigned to break down work into smaller sections. This process also helps understanding of the task to better prepare teams for the required work.

Story points benefits:
- The discussion makes teams more prepared and ready for the upcoming workload.
- The discussion also helps understanding of each feature and its Implementation.
- Story points reward team members based on difficulty instead of time spent.
- This process repeated over and over for different projects will lead to a better understanding of the capabilities of the team and time required.
