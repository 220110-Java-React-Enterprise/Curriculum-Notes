## Agile Concepts

### Agile

The image above outlines how plan-driven processes and agile development are different. Plan-driven processes have their iterations within separate stages. Documentation is then created to move to the next stage. However, in the agile approach, the activities requirements and implementation are done at the same time.

Rapid development and delivery is an important factor for software engineering
as software needs to be able to address new changes to requirements. Agile methods were developed to account for these developments.

Agile characteristics:

- The scope of the project is kept dynamic so it can easily be adjusted by changing situations or conditions.
- Systems are usually developed in increments so that consumers and other stakeholders can give their input during the development phase. This helps keep the vision of the stakeholders and development team aligned.
- Many tools are used to aid during development like tools that automatically test your code, help you make the process of designing and creating the user interface easier, etc. This generally helps save time and labor to focus more on the goals and targets of the project.

#### [Agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)

The agile manifesto is a collection of principles that explain the reasoning behind the agile approach:

- **Customer involvement**
  - Stakeholders should give their input in all stages of the development process to show what components should be prioritized and give input that can be analyzed to evaluate the progress of every iteration.
- **Embrace change**
  - Change is inevitable therefore the system should be designed in such a way to relieve the potential stress caused by change.
- **Incremental delivery**
  - Software should be incrementally developed in small batches to test components and allow for feedback.
- **Maintain simplicity**
  - Systems should be simple where applicable.
- **People, not process**
  - People's skills should be recognized and used.

#### Agile User Stories

The above image depicts an example of a user story. In this case it describes what a doctor would see when prescribing medication to a patient on the required application.

To combine requirements elicitation, which is the process of getting requirements from customers/clients, with development, user stories are used. User stories are what the name implies: a story on how the user interacts with the software. "Story cards" are developed from these stories and focus on what stakeholders need from the software. These stories and needs will become a list of specifications that need to be met by the development team.

Advantages of user stories:
- Stories are more relatable than documentation
- Stories can suggest what are key requirements the software must have or do. In other words, they are helpful for requirements elicitation.

Disadvantages of user stories:
- Users may not go over all the requirements they need from one story.
- Stories may not give a good view of the requirements.
- Terminology differs from developer and consumer as consumers are more familiar with the software.
- This may lead to consumers leaving out details when describing how they use an application as they are used to using it and may deem actions useless or forgettable.

#### Agile Refactoring

Code should be refactored, or in other words improved, constantly. Refactoring includes renaming names of methods and attributes, removing duplicate code to reorganize class hierarchies and relationships, replacing code that is similar to each other, etc. The objective of doing this is to make developers understand the software more which would lead to less of a need for documentation due to the code being easier to understand and structured well.

#### Agile Test First Development

Test first or test driven development means that tests are written before the actual code. This allows tests to run alongside the development of the code to find any errors early. It also means that developers understand exactly what they are supposed to be making before starting to write code. Users can also be more involved this way as their data or dummy data can be used to test the system.

#### Scrum

The above image depicts a Scrum sprint cycle.

Scrum is an agile approach that focuses on the management and organization of iterative development. There are three main phases in Scrum:

- **Initial Phase**: begin by outlining objectives for the project and a rough design of the software architecture.
- **Sprint Cycles**: are the incremental portion of development; each cycle will develop an increment of the project.
- **Closure phase**: involves wrapping up the project and completing any documentation that is required

The above image explains what different commonly used Scrum terms mean.

Scrum sprints have a fixed length (usually 2 - 4 weeks) and begin by the creation of a list of objectives and work that should be done, this is called the product backlog. The selection phase is next, where features and functionalities are selected from the product backlog. These will be the components that will be worked on during the sprint as they are usually the components deemed to be the most important and can be reasonably done well during the time frame. After this stage, teams are organized to develop the software.

Teams will hold short daily meetings known as Scrums to discuss current progress and any changes they need to make towards prioritization of features. This allows everyone on the team to know what is currently happening and can re-plan activities quickly if needed. The Scrum Master will help organizing the sprint. They are tasked to arrange the daily Scrums, track what is being done and what has to be done, communicate with stakeholders and management, and other such organizational activities.

Scrum benefits:
- Development is broken into multiple iterations that are manageable and understandable.
- The whole process is visible as the whole team knows the current progress of development due to the daily scrums.
- Change  will not cause delays as the team can quickly adapt to the change.
- Customers will get fast delivery of increments which will allow them to give feedback earlier.
