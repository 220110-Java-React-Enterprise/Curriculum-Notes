# Spring Module - MVC Architecture

This page details an overview of the Spring MVC Framework and explains how to utilize this framework to create a Spring based Web application




## Spring Model View Controller Architecture
The Spring MVC Framework, like many other MVC Frameworks, is a request driven structure, designed around a central Servlet which dispatches requests to controllers and offers functionality to support the web application. As a breif recap, Models represent data to be stored and/or retrieved from a database or environment, the View is the user interface and displays model data and the controller handles requests between the model and responds with appropriate views. Unlike other MVC frameworks, the Spring `DispatcherServlet` is completely itegrated with the Spring IoC container, allowing the use of every other Spring feature in addition to this functionality. A high level overview of this request processing structure can be viewed below:

### Dispatcher Servlet and MVC
The Spring Web Model-View-Controller (MVC) Framework is based on the use of a `DispatcherServlet`, which uses a `FrontController` design pattern. This `DispatcherServlet` routes requests to configurable handlers, view resolutions, and also provides support for uploading files. The default controller is based on the `@Controller` stereotype annotation, as well as the `@RequestMapping` annotation, both of which are detailed in the notes below.

The `DispatcherServlet`, as you may guess, is an actual `Servlet`. As such, it must inherit it's functionality from the `HttpServlet` base class, and is declared in the _web.xml_ file of your application. Any requests you want the `DispatcherServlet` to handle must also be mapped in the same _web.xml_ file. As a reminder, Servlets require a top-level Servlet element in which servlet-name, servlet-class and other optional elements (such as load-on-startup) are nested. Request Mappings utilize the top-level servlet-mapping element with nested servlet-name and url-pattern elements

For Example:
```
<web-app>
    <servlet>
        <description>This is an optional description of this servlet. An example servlet</description>
        <servlet-name>exampleServlet</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>com.revature.web.Dispatcher</servlet-class>
        <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
    </servlet>

    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>example</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/example/*</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>

</web-app>
```

In this example, all requests which start with _/example_ will be handled by the `Dispatcher`, which is named _exampleServlet_.


### ViewResolvers and InternalResourceView
Before Discussing annotations, it is worth briefly discussing how views are resolved. All Spring Web MVC controllers must resolve to a logical view name, either explicitly (for example, returning a String, View or ModelAndView) or implicitly (i.e. based on conventions). In Spring, these views are resolved by a view resolver using a logical view name. Spring has a number of view resolvers, though we will only breifly discuss a few (more information can be found in the [Spring Documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-viewresolver)):

* AbstractCachingViewResolver: Abstract view resolver which, when extended, can cache views.
* XmlViewResolver: Implementation of ViewResolver that accepts an XML configuration file with the same DTD as Spring’s XML bean factories. The default configuration file is /WEB-INF/views.xml.
* UrlBasedViewResolver: Implementation of the ViewResolver which directly resolves view names to URLs, without an explicit mapping definition. Useful if if your logical names match the names of your views.
* InternalResourceViewResolver: Subclass of UrlBasedViewResolver that supports InternalResourceView (such as Servlets and JSPs) and subclasses (such as JstlView and TilesView). View classes for all views generated by this resolver can be set using setViewClass(..) Method. See the [UrlBasedViewResolver javadocs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/4.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/view/UrlBasedViewResolver.html) for more details.

The `InternalResourceView` is a Wrapper class for JSP or other resources within the same web application. It can be used to expose model objects as request attributes and forward requests to a specified resource URL using the `RequestDispatcher`. In particular the `InteralResourceViewResolver` supports definitions for `InternalResourceView`s for a simple and straightforward resolution of `@Controller` class methods. 

For example:
```
<bean id="viewResolver" class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.InternalResourceViewResolver">
   <property name="prefix" value="/WEB-INF/jsp/"/>
   <property name="suffix" value=".jsp"/>
 </bean>
```


### Spring Web Annotations
As discussed in the [stereotype annotation lecture notes](../a-framework/stereotypes.md), the `@Controller` annotation specifies a class as a _controller_, a special type of bean used particularly to handle web application requests. The introduction of the `@Controller` annotation, as of Spring 3.0, allows for the creation of RESTful Web services and applications through the use of the `@PathVariable` annotation as well as other flexible features. The dispatcher will scan these `@Controller`-annotated and `@RequestMapping`-annotated classes and detect any `@RequestMapping`-annotated methods. Depending on the context, this `@RequestMapping` annotation can be configured with url mapping, http request method types, url values, and other parameters. 

For example (Example from Spring Documentation):
```java
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/appointments")
public class AppointmentsController {

    private final AppointmentBook appointmentBook;

    @Autowired
    public AppointmentsController(AppointmentBook appointmentBook) {
        this.appointmentBook = appointmentBook;
    }

    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public Map<String, Appointment> get() {
        return appointmentBook.getAppointmentsForToday();
    }

    @RequestMapping(value="/{day}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public Map<String, Appointment> getForDay(@PathVariable @DateTimeFormat(iso=ISO.DATE) Date day, Model model) {
        return appointmentBook.getAppointmentsForDay(day);
    }

    @RequestMapping(value="/new", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public AppointmentForm getNewForm() {
        return new AppointmentForm();
    }

    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST)
    public String add(@Valid AppointmentForm appointment, BindingResult result) {
        if (result.hasErrors()) {
            return "appointments/new";
        }
        appointmentBook.addAppointment(appointment);
        return "redirect:/appointments";
    }
}
```
In this example, requests to the _AppointmentsController_ are indicated by the "/appointments" url, and may handle a combination of GET as well as POST HTTP methods depending on the information provided. If a GET request is made simply to /appointments, then the controller will return a Map using the `getAppointmentsForToday()` method. If the GET request is made to the url "/appointments/new", then an _AppointmentForm_ will be returned using the `AppointmentForm()` method.

Additionally, the special _redirect_ prefix used here allows for a `UrlBasedViewResolver` (and subclasses) to recognize that a redirect is needed, and may resolve the view using the logical name. When using this _redirect_ prefix supports both relative and absolute URLs:
relative*:
```
    return: "redirect:appointments/new";
```
*We used a relative path above

absolute
```
    return: "https://revature.com"";
```


### `@RequestBody`
After defining a Request Mapping, there are a number of ways to detect and utilize variables sent with the request. For information within the body of the request, you should use `@RequestBody`, which allows Spring to map data from the body of a request to a defined java object.

REQUEST:
```
<form action="loginExample" method="POST">
	<input type="text" name="username" value="Revature">
	<input type="password" name="password" value="password">
	<input type="submit" value="Post Data">
</form>
```

LOGIN OBJECT:
```
public class LoginForm {
	private String username;
	private String password;
	
	// constructors, getters, setters, etc...
}
```

CONTROLLER:
```
@Controller("examplePost")
public class ExampleController {

	...

	@RequestMapping(value="/loginExample", method=RequestMethod.POST)
	@ResponseStatus(value = HttpStatus.OK)
	public void postData(@RequestBody LoginForm loginForm) {
		System.out.println("Login values [username]: " + loginForm.getUsername()
		+ ", [password]: " + loginForm.getPassword());
	}
}
```


### `@ResponseStatus`
When a specific view is not returned, the logical name used is based on the value of the `@RequestMapping`, however you should still provide some response. The `@ResponseStatus` annotation marks a method or exception class with an HTTP response status code, as well as the reason that should be returned. These examples use this annotation primarily for debugging purposes, but this annotation can be useful when you do not expect to return a particular view from a controller.


### `@RequestParam`
Alternatively the `@RequestParam` annotation should be used to bind request parameters to specific values in the mapped method's signature. You may specify values when using `@RequestParam` either using the name attribute, or simply with the name (or value) of the parameter.
REQUEST:
```
<form action="loginExample" method="POST">
	<input type="text" name="username" value="Revature">
	<input type="password" name="password" value="password">
	<input type="submit" value="Post Data">
</form>
```

CONTROLLER:
```
@Controller("examplePost")
public class ExampleController {

	...

	@RequestMapping(value="/loginExample", method=RequestMethod.POST)
	@ResponseStatus(value = HttpStatus.OK)
	public void postData(@RequestParam(name="username") String username, @RequestParam("password") String password) {
		System.out.println("Login values [username]: " + username + ", [password]: " + password);
	}
}
```

The `@RequestParam` annotation also has a `required` attribute which dictates whether the specified parameter must be present for the request to complete. By default, this parameter is set to true, but can be optionally set to false:
`@RequestParam(name="id", required="false")`. Note that all of these examples could be expressed with the value attribute instead of the name attribute, which is functionally the same: `@RequestParam(value="id", required="false")`.


### `@PathVariable`
Finally, the `@PathVariable` annotation can identify properties directly within the URL of a request for use within a method. To map the url parameter, the parameter should be enclosed in curly braces within the RequestMapping value and the name should match the method parameter:

CONTROLLER:
```
@Controller
public class LibraryController {
	...

	@RequestMapping(value="/library/{bookISBN}", method=RequestMethod.GET)
	public String getBookName(@PathVariable int bookISBN) {
		switch (bookISBN) {
			case 12345:
				return "harry-potter";
			case 54321:
				return "huckleyberry-finn";
			default:
				return "error";
		}
	}
}
```


### `@RequestHeader`
In addition to request parameters and body content, header data can be viewed and mapped to a method in a similar syntax to the `@RequestParam` annotation. This mapping uses, as you may expect, the `@RequestHeader` annotation.

For example:
HEADER:
```
Host                    localhost:8080
Accept                  text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9
Accept-Language         fr,en-gb;q=0.7,en;q=0.3
Accept-Encoding         gzip,deflate
Accept-Charset          ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7
Keep-Alive              300
```

CONTROLLER:
```
@RequestMapping("/displayHeaderInfo.do")
public void displayHeaderInfo(@RequestHeader("Accept-Encoding") String encoding,
        @RequestHeader("Keep-Alive") long keepAlive) {
    //...
}
```


### `@ResponseBody`
Configuration for responding to Requests can also be simplified with the Spring MVC Framework through the use of the `@ResponseBody` annotation. This annotation can be used to automatically marshal java objects into a JSON String.

CONTROLLER:
```
@Controller
public class LibraryController {
	@Autowired
	private LibraryService libraryService;

	...

	@RequestMapping(value="/library/all", method=RequestMethod.GET)
	public @ResponseBody List<Book> getAllBooks() {
		return libraryService.getAllBooks();
	}
}
```
This method would return a list of Book Objects as a JSON string, allowing the response to be parsed and displayed on a webpage.


### `@RestController`
Commonly, Spring Web Controllers implement a REST API, thus serving JSON, XML or custom MediaType content. As such, the `@RestController` annotation is a convenience stereotype annotation which combines the features of `@Controller` with the `@ResponseBody` annotations. This allows the use of HTTP method specific Mapping annotations which automatically produce an XML, JSON or other response.

CONTROLLER:
```
@RestController
@RequestMapping("rest-library")
public class LibraryRestController {
	@Autowired
	private LibraryService libraryService;

	...

	@GetMapping("/all")
	public List<Book> getAllBooks() {
		return libraryService.getAllBooks();
	}

	@GetMapping("/{isbn}")
	public Book getBook(@PathVariable int id) {
		return libraryService.getBookByISBN(isbn);
	}
```

### Dispatcher Servlet and MVC

The Spring Web Model-View-Controller (MVC) Framework is based on the use of a `DispatcherServlet`, which uses a `FrontController` design pattern. This `DispatcherServlet` routes requests to configurable handlers, view resolutions, and also provides support for uploading files. The default controller is based on the `@Controller` stereotype annotation, as well as the `@RequestMapping` annotation, both of which are detailed in the notes below.

As such, it must inherit it's functionality from the `HttpServlet` base class, and is declared in the _web.xml_ file of your application. Any requests you want the `DispatcherServlet` to handle must also be mapped in the same _web.xml_ file. As a reminder, Servlets require a top-level Servlet element in which servlet-name, servlet-class and other optional elements (such as load-on-startup) are nested. Request Mappings utilize the top-level servlet-mapping element with nested servlet-name and url-pattern elements

For Example:

```
<web-app>
    <servlet>
        <description>This is an optional description of this servlet. An example servlet</description>
        <servlet-name>exampleServlet</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>com.revature.web.Dispatcher</servlet-class>
        <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
    </servlet>

    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>example</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/example/*</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>

</web-app>
```

In this example, all requests which start with _/example_ will be handled by the `Dispatcher`, which is named _exampleServlet_.

### ViewResolvers and InternalResourceView

Before Discussing annotations, it is worth briefly discussing how views are resolved. All Spring Web MVC controllers must resolve to a logical view name, either explicitly (for example, returning a String, View or ModelAndView) or implicitly (i.e. based on conventions). In Spring, these views are resolved by a view resolver using a logical view name. Spring has a number of view resolvers, though we will only breifly discuss a few (more information can be found in the [Spring Documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-viewresolver)):

- AbstractCachingViewResolver: Abstract view resolver which, when extended, can cache views.
- XmlViewResolver: Implementation of ViewResolver that accepts an XML configuration file with the same DTD as Spring’s XML bean factories. The default configuration file is /WEB-INF/views.xml.
- UrlBasedViewResolver: Implementation of the ViewResolver which directly resolves view names to URLs, without an explicit mapping definition. Useful if if your logical names match the names of your views.
- InternalResourceViewResolver: Subclass of UrlBasedViewResolver that supports InternalResourceView (such as Servlets and JSPs) and subclasses (such as JstlView and TilesView). View classes for all views generated by this resolver can be set using setViewClass(..) Method. See the [UrlBasedViewResolver javadocs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/4.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/view/UrlBasedViewResolver.html) for more details.

The `InternalResourceView` is a Wrapper class for JSP or other resources within the same web application. It can be used to expose model objects as request attributes and forward requests to a specified resource URL using the `RequestDispatcher`. In particular the `InteralResourceViewResolver` supports definitions for `InternalResourceView`s for a simple and straightforward resolution of `@Controller` class methods.

For example:

```
<bean id="viewResolver" class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.InternalResourceViewResolver">
   <property name="prefix" value="/WEB-INF/jsp/"/>
   <property name="suffix" value=".jsp"/>
 </bean>
```

Depending on the context, this `@RequestMapping` annotation can be configured with url mapping, http request method types, url values, and other parameters.

For example (Example from Spring Documentation):

```
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/appointments")
public class AppointmentsController {

    private final AppointmentBook appointmentBook;

    @Autowired
    public AppointmentsController(AppointmentBook appointmentBook) {
        this.appointmentBook = appointmentBook;
    }

    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public Map<String, Appointment> get() {
        return appointmentBook.getAppointmentsForToday();
    }

    @RequestMapping(value="/{day}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public Map<String, Appointment> getForDay(@PathVariable @DateTimeFormat(iso=ISO.DATE) Date day, Model model) {
        return appointmentBook.getAppointmentsForDay(day);
    }

    @RequestMapping(value="/new", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public AppointmentForm getNewForm() {
        return new AppointmentForm();
    }

    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST)
    public String add(@Valid AppointmentForm appointment, BindingResult result) {
        if (result.hasErrors()) {
            return "appointments/new";
        }
        appointmentBook.addAppointment(appointment);
        return "redirect:/appointments";
    }
}
```

In this example, requests to the _AppointmentsController_ are indicated by the "/appointments" url, and may handle a combination of GET as well as POST HTTP methods depending on the information provided. If a GET request is made simply to /appointments, then the controller will return a Map using the `getAppointmentsForToday()` method. If the GET request is made to the url "/appointments/new", then an _AppointmentForm_ will be returned using the `AppointmentForm()` method.

Additionally, the special _redirect_ prefix used here allows for a `UrlBasedViewResolver` (and subclasses) to recognize that a redirect is needed, and may resolve the view using the logical name. When using this _redirect_ prefix supports both relative and absolute URLs:
relative\*:

```
    return: "redirect:appointments/new";
```

\*We used a relative path above

absolute

```
    return: "https://revature.com"";
```

### `@RequestBody`

After defining a Request Mapping, there are a number of ways to detect and utilize variables sent with the request. For information within the body of the request, you should use `@RequestBody`, which allows Spring to map data from the body of a request to a defined java object.

REQUEST:

```
<form action="loginExample" method="POST">
	<input type="text" name="username" value="Revature">
	<input type="password" name="password" value="password">
	<input type="submit" value="Post Data">
</form>
```

LOGIN OBJECT:

```
public class LoginForm {
	private String username;
	private String password;

	// constructors, getters, setters, etc...
}
```

CONTROLLER:

```
@Controller("examplePost")
public class ExampleController {

	...

	@RequestMapping(value="/loginExample", method=RequestMethod.POST)
	@ResponseStatus(value = HttpStatus.OK)
	public void postData(@RequestBody LoginForm loginForm) {
		System.out.println("Login values [username]: " + loginForm.getUsername()
		+ ", [password]: " + loginForm.getPassword());
	}
}
```

### `@ResponseStatus`

When a specific view is not returned, the logical name used is based on the value of the `@RequestMapping`, however you should still provide some response. The `@ResponseStatus` annotation marks a method or exception class with an HTTP response status code, as well as the reason that should be returned. These examples use this annotation primarily for debugging purposes, but this annotation can be useful when you do not expect to return a particular view from a controller.

### `@RequestParam`

Alternatively the `@RequestParam` annotation should be used to bind request parameters to specific values in the mapped method's signature. You may specify values when using `@RequestParam` either using the name attribute, or simply with the name (or value) of the parameter.
REQUEST:

	<input type="text" name="username" value="Revature">
	<input type="password" name="password" value="password">
	<input type="submit" value="Post Data">
</form>
```

CONTROLLER:

```
@Controller("examplePost")
public class ExampleController {

	...

	@RequestMapping(value="/loginExample", method=RequestMethod.POST)
	@ResponseStatus(value = HttpStatus.OK)
	public void postData(@RequestParam(name="username") String username, @RequestParam("password") String password) {
		System.out.println("Login values [username]: " + username + ", [password]: " + password);
	}
}
```

The `@RequestParam` annotation also has a `required` attribute which dictates whether the specified parameter must be present for the request to complete. By default, this parameter is set to true, but can be optionally set to false:
`@RequestParam(name="id", required="false")`. Note that all of these examples could be expressed with the value attribute instead of the name attribute, which is functionally the same: `@RequestParam(value="id", required="false")`.

Accept-Charset          ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7
Keep-Alive              300
```

CONTROLLER:
