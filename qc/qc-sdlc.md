# SDLC

* What are the steps in the software development lifecycle?
    1. Planning / Requirements gathering
    2. Analysis
    3. Design
    4. Development
    5. Testing
    6. Deployment
    7. Maintenance
* What is the difference between Waterfall and Agile methodologies? Explain the benefits and drawbacks of each
    * Waterfall: linear, one-way, unable to make changes; best for projects with fixed, rigid requirements or highly regulated
    * Agile: iterative approach, customer collaboration, responding to change; best for projects in dynamic environments where adaptation required
* List some of the principles declared in the Agile manifesto
    * Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software
    * Welcome changing requirements
    * Preference for shorter timescale for releases
    * Business people & developers work together
    * Value face to face conversation for communication
    * Working software is the primary measure of progress
    * Sustainable development - should be able to maintain constant pace
    * Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
    * Simplicity – the art of maximizing the amount of work not done – is essential.
    * The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
    * At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
* What specific Agile frameworks exist? What are the main features of each?
    * XP (Extreme programming) - paired programming, code reviews
    * Scrum - sprints, daily standups, story pointing
    * Kanban - kanban board
* What is the Scrum process? Explain each of the Scrum ceremonies
    * Sprint planning meeting
    * Daily scrum (standups)
    * Sprint review
    * Sprint retrospective
* How long is a typical sprint?
    * 2-4 weeks
* What is a "standup" and what should you report about your work?
    * Short, ~15 min total; update on the status of everyone's work
    * What you worked on yesterday, what you plan to work on today, and any blockers you have
* What is the role of a "Scrum master" in a project? What about the "Product owner"?
    * Scrum master is like the cheerleader / advocate for the team; they make sure nothing is in the team's way
    * Product owner sets the vision for the product, helps with generating requirements / user stories and prioritizing
* Explain the following metrics/charts: sprint velocity, burndown chart
    * Velocity - average story points completed per sprint
    * Burndown chart - showing reduction in outstanding story points over the sprint
* What is a Scrum board? Have you used any software tools for your team's Scrum board?
    * Board that has multiple columns as categories for the state of user stories
    * Backlog, Todo, In Progress, Done are typical categories
* What is the "Definition of Done"?
    * The requirements the team agrees have to be met for a user story to be considered "done"
    * Example: all unit tests pass, code is reviewed and merged in feature branch, non-functional requirements met
* Name some technologies teams can use to keep track of progress on different projects, tasks, and due dates.
    * JIRA, Github projects, Trello, Asana
