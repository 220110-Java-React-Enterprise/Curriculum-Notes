# QC Questions on Microservices
 - Describe the microservice architecture pattern.
   - In contrast to a monolithic application MSA splits the different functionality into many small independent services that run on their own, and may even have their own individual database.
 - How are microservices different than SOA?
   - In MSA the services are usually smaller and more specific, and there are many more of them. 
   - In SOA traditionally there is still only one datasource, in MSA each service may have it's own datasource. 
   - SOA was envisioned split modules into separate services, MSA was envisioned to further split into independent services the smallest logical units.
   - MSA is considered an extension of SOA. SOA made applications more modular, MSA continued this trend.
 - What are some advantages to using microservices?
   - Fault tolerance - is a service goes down, the other services stay up and can resume functionality when the service comes back.
   - Scalability - particularly horizontal scalability - the nature of MSA makes it very easy to scale up and down as needed.
   - Delegation - Efforts can be split into multiple dev teams working on individual services.
   - Refactorability - Making significant changes to a service doesn't impact the other services.
   - Tech Independence - We can choose the perfect technologies for a given service, each servie having it's own frameworks, libraries, and even languages.
 - What are some disadvantages to using microservices?
   - Complexity - design of good MSA solutions is far more complex than traditional monoliths.
   - Cost - With greater complexity comes greater cost: human resources, knowlege, time, money, all costs go up.
 - What is a "monolithic" application?
   - A application designed and deployed as a single service (or maybe two in client-server), this was the traditional way of writing solutions.
 - Can a Java microservice communicate with a Node.js microservice? Why or why not? 
   - Yes. Microservies can be designed with completely different techs and environments, and communicate with a common protocol (Like JSON or XML).
 - How would you approach deconstructing a monolith into microservices?
   - Identify logical units that can operate independently, like layers, modules, classes, and separate these into independent services.
   - Identify which data goes with which services and split the datasource into multiple datasources.
   - Establish some protocols for communication between services.
   - Splitting the application apart introduces new requirements for things like: gateway, configuration, load balancing, session management, monitoring, and detection. Se we need solutions to these new problems as well. 
 - What design patterns are commonly used in microservices?
 - What implementation of API Gateway have you used?
 - What implementation of Service Discovery have you used?
 - What implementation of Circuit Breaker are you familiar with?
 - Who made tools like Eureka, Zuul, and Hystrix?
 - Where did the dependencies Eureka, Zuul, and Hystrix come from?
 - What is the purpose of an API gateway and how does Zuul perform this? 
 - What is service discovery and how does Eureka do this? 
 - What is the circuit breaker pattern and how does Hystrix implement it? What are the different circuit states? 
 - How would you configure a Eureka server? (describe dependencies, .yml file, and annotations)
 - How would you configure a Eureka client? (describe dependencies, .yml file, and annotations)
 - How would you configure a config server? (describe dependencies, .yml file, and annotations)
 - How would you configure a Zuul reverse proxy? (describe dependencies, .yml file, and annotations)
 - Describe how you would configure Zuul routes.
 - What are Zuul filters? Name some different kinds.
 - Explain how persistence works in a distributed architecture.
 - What is a heartbeat in context of Spring Cloud microservices?
 - If using centralized configuration, what is a recommended order to spin up microservices locally?
 - How can we establish synchronous communication between our microservices?
 - What is FeignClient?
 - How can you increase the resilency of your microservice architecture?
 - How can we establish asynchronous communication between our microservices?
 - What are messaging queues? What technologies did you work with to implement messaging queues?
 - Name some other technologies that serve as messaging queue solutions
