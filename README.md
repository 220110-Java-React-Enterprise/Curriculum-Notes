# 220110 - Java React Enterprise

Welcome to Revature! Over the course of this curriculum we will prepare you to break into the industry as full stack software developers. This curriculum is primarily Java and foundational programming concepts. The curriculum will also include SQL, JavaScript, TypeScript, and several modern libraries and frameworks. Here we will keep our notes and any pertinent info. Much of the same content can be found in RevPro as well, but this will be our primary repository for such things.
