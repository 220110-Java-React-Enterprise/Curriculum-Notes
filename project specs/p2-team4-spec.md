# Project 2 - Team 4 - Bed, Breakfast & Java:

## Description
Your next project will build upon the concepts from project 0 & 1, adding the following topics:
 - HTML/CSS/JS
 - CI/CD
 - Spring Boot
 - Spring Data
 - Spring Web

You will be building a client/server application with a frontend and backend. Your application will use a third party API to get data useful to the service you provide. What service that is, is up to you. Your team should consider your options and come up with an idea for a client/server application that can utilize a third party API to grab data. Your application should meet the minimum requirements set forth below. Your team will work with your trainer to create a series of user stories for your application's MVP.
  
You will be expected to complete the minimum viable product by the deadline and give a brief presentation demonstrating your project and answering questions from the audience.

This project will be done in teams of 5-6 members that will be assigned when we begin.

### Minimum Requirements
1. Proper use of OOP principles and a well layered application structure
2. Users are interfacing with a basic UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript running in a browser
4. CRUD operations are supported for one or more domain objects via the web application's API endpoints
5. Client/Server communication is done with JSON in HTTP request and response bodies.
6. All low-level persistence logic is abstracted away with Hibernate/Spring Data
7. Documentation (all classes and methods have adequate Javadoc comments)
8. All Exceptions are caught and logged
9. Data useful to the application is retrieved from a third party API
10. Server is hosted on AWS


### Bonus Features
1. Unit test coverage of service-layer classes
2. Basic (cypher) or advanced (shashed) encryption for secure data in HTTP exchanges
3. DevOps CI/CD pipeline is used to build and deploy project to a publicly available remote location


## Bed, Breakfast & Java
A great hotel can sometimes be hard to find. This app offers a way to find hotels in the area with ease.
BB&J allows users to compare the pricing and availability of hotels in order to book the best option.
Photos and reviews are provided to the user giving them all the information they need.
After staying, users can then write their own reviews.
Administrators can add or remove hotels.
Administrators are able to view all of their bookings and cancel them if needed.
We utilize API's provided by Rapid API. (https://www.rapidapi.com/)

### Minimum Viable Product
Your team will need to work with the trainer to come up with a satisfactory list of user stories for MVP as well as bonus stories. They should begin with "As a [stakeholder] I can... and describe what the user should be able to do. Aim for at least 2 different roles, perhaps user and administrator. Try to come up with 6-8 user stories for MVP. Carefully consider what your team can accomplish in 2 weeks and try not to set yourselves too great a task.

## User Stories:
- As a user, I can login/register.
- As a user, I can choose a destination offered through the listing.
- As a user, I can choose specific dates for booking a stay.
- As a user, I can see details about location
- As a user, I can cancel a booking
- As an admin, I can view all of my hotel bookings.
- As an admin, I can update/cancel hotel bookings.
- As an admin, I can add/remove hotel listings.

    
## Bonus stories:
- As a user, I can see photos of the location


## Tech Stack
You should be employing the following technologies in your project.
 - Java 8
 - JavaScript/TypeScript
 - HTML & CSS
 - Apache Maven for dependencies and project management
 - Git & Github for version control
 - MariaDB deployed on AWS RDS for data persistence
 - AWS EC2, ElasticBeanstalk, S3, CodeBuild, CodePipeline for CI/CD pipeline
 - Spring Boot, Web, Data

## Deadline & Presentation
