# Project 0

## Description

Your first project should demonstrate your knowledge of the following topics: 
 - Java
 - SQL
 - JDBC
 - Basic Data Structures
 - Basic File I/O

You will be building a console application that persists data in a database with at least 2 tables which adhere to 3rd normal form (3NF). This will take the form of a CCG collection manager.
  
You will be expected to complete the minimum viable product by the deadline and give a brief 5 minute presentation demonstrating your project and answering questions from the QC team.


### Minimum Requirements
- Validation (malformed emails)
- Exception handling
- Documentation
- Custom data structures (self-made ArrayList)
- SQL Data Persistance (Users_Table, Card_Collection_Table)

### Bonus Features
- Unit tests for service-layer classes
- Logging messages and exceptions to a file
- Card_Table for all existing cards in the game.
- User adds cards via fuzzy search, so they don't have to type the full name most of the time.


## CCG Collection Manager User Stories
These are user stories to describe the banking app. If you are not building the banking app for your project, you will need to discuss with your trainer to establish proper user stories.

### Minimum Viable Product
